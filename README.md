# Data-Mining-Project
Welcome to the Data Mining Project conducted by Faridreza Momtazzandi and Alireza Noorbakhsh. This project was one of our biggest and most proud works in our university-related projects so we're really happy to present it to you! Feel free to ask us any questions you might ever have on this project.

## Introduction
This repository contains the comprehensive analysis of a data mining project, focusing on the exploration, cleaning, and analysis of complex datasets related to assets. The project is divided into four phases, each targeting specific objectives and questions regarding the assets dataset. The primary goal is to gain insights, answer critical and real-world questions, and make informed predictions using data mining techniques. The analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebooks and the Pandas library in Python.
This dataset was given to us by the Department of Finance and Assets so we can work on a real-world dataset.

## Phase 1: Data Understanding and Exploration
In this phase, we aimed to understand the structure of the datasets, identify key attributes, and assess data quality. The main datasets explored are INOUT, INOUTLINE, and PRODUCTINSTANCE. Techniques used include:
- Data loading and initial exploration
- Summary statistics and data visualization
- Handling missing values and duplicate records
- Determining data types and distributions

## Phase 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Building on the knowledge gained in Phase 1, the focus of this phase was on data cleaning and preparation for subsequent analysis and preparing the dataset for accurate analysis in subsequent phases. Techniques employed:
- Dealing with outliers and anomalies
- Addressing inconsistent data formats and units
- Data transformation (e.g., date parsing, encoding)
- Ensuring data consistency and integrity

## Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis and Insights
In this phase, we delved deeper into the data to answer specific questions about asset inflow, outflow, and organizational aspects. We analyzed the incoming rate of assets over different years, examined assets based on holding and accounting units, and investigated the status of accounting documents. Techniques applied:
- Aggregating data by various attributes
- Extracting insights using descriptive statistics
- Analyzing trends and patterns over time and organizations
- Identifying correlations and relationships among attributes

## Phase 4: Advanced Analysis and Prediction
The final phase continued the analysis from Phase 3, concentrating on asset inflow and outflow over time and by organization. We calculated the ratio of purchased assets to returned assets for each organization. Additionally, we clustered assets based on their creation year and primal value, to predict prices within clusters. 
The final phase involved more advanced techniques and predictive analysis. Techniques and processes utilized:
- Clustering assets based on attributes (e.g., year, value)
- Predicting prices within clusters for similar assets
- Extracting patterns from time and organizational data
- Providing recommendations and insights for asset management

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the step-by-step process of exploring, cleaning, and analyzing complex and real-world datasets to extract valuable insights and make informed decisions. By utilizing data mining techniques, we were able to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns within the asset data, providing actionable recommendations for asset management and strategic planning.
